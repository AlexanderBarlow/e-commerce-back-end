# E-Commerce Backend

## Description

An e-commerce site is in need of a backend. This is so they can hit multiple end points to retreive and manipulate data. This will be done using mySQL and Express.js along with Sequelize to build out desired routes for data.

## Installation

As shown in video one, run SOURCE SCHEMA in the mysql shell. Then proceed to run the seeds as shown. We are then ready to kick off our server with node server.js.
From here, we can test our end points in Insomnia.

## Usage

The first video shows how to create the database, seed the database and start the server. The second shows how to test the endpoints and the result of such.
